## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Users
- `POST /api/users/init` - Create/retrieve user by device ID
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get specific user

### Posts
- `GET /api/posts?userId=:id` - Get all posts or posts by user
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new post (requires auth)

### Follows
- `GET /api/follows/following` - Get users you follow (requires auth)
- `GET /api/follows/status/:userId` - Check if following (requires auth)
- `POST /api/follows` - Follow a user (requires auth)
- `DELETE /api/follows/:userId` - Unfollow a user (requires auth)

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Device-Based Auth
**Why**: Removes friction - users can start immediately
**Trade-off**: Accounts tied to browser (acceptable for MVP)
**Future**: Easy to add Google OAuth upgrade path

### 2. 20-Word Limit
**Why**: Forces quality over quantity
**Benefit**: Quick to read, easy to scan
**Psychology**: Constraint drives creativity

### 3. Public by Default
**Why**: Simplifies initial development
**Benefit**: Easier to test and demo
**Future**: Can add privacy controls later

### 4. Category-First Design
**Why**: Enables category-specific features (like Maps for restaurants)
**Benefit**: Organized, searchable, extensible
**Future**: Can add category-specific templates

### 5. SQLite for Development
**Why**: No external dependencies, instant setup
**Trade-off**: Data resets on deploy (document clearly)
**Migration**: Clear path to PostgreSQL for production

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (For Testing)
1. Run `npm run dev` to start everything
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Create some posts
4. Test with multiple browsers

### Short Term (Before Sharing)
1. Get Google Maps API key for embedded maps
2. Add a few sample posts for demo
3. Test on mobile devices
4. Fix any responsive issues

### Deployment (When Ready)
1. Choose hosting: Render (recommended), Railway, or Vercel
2. Set up PostgreSQL database
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy and test
5. Share URL with friends!

### Future Enhancements
- Image uploads for posts
- Comments/reactions
- Activity feed (posts from followed users)
- Search and filters
- Collections/saved posts
- Email notifications
- Advanced Google Maps (embedded, not just links)
- Category-specific fields (director for movies, author for books)

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Complete
- All core functionality
- Database structure
- API layer
- Frontend pages and components

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Development
- Use Chrome DevTools to test different devices
- Open multiple browser types to simulate multiple users
- Check browser console for any errors
- Database file is `scrapbook.db` in root (can delete to reset)

### For Demo
- Create a few posts beforehand in different categories

- Show the follow feature
- Demonstrate the restaurant with location feature

### For Deployment
- Read `DEPLOYMENT.md` carefully
- Set all environment variables
- Test thoroughly before sharing
- Consider PostgreSQL for data persistence

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Everything is built and ready to run. Follow the steps in `START.md` to get it running locally, test it out, and when you're happy with it, follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` to put it online!

The codebase is clean, well-organized, and ready to extend with new features as you think of them.
