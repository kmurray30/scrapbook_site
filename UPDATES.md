# Latest Updates

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Color Theme Switching Bug - FIXED
**Problem**: Getting "SyntaxError: The string did not match the expected pattern" when changing colors

**Solution**: 
- Improved error handling in API request function to gracefully handle non-JSON error responses
- Added user existence check in theme endpoint to prevent null returns
- Better validation in `server/routes/users.js`

**How it works now**: 
- Better error catching in `client/src/services/api.js`
- Handles both JSON and non-JSON error responses
- Validates user exists before updating theme
- More descriptive error messages

### 2. Sample Data Auto-Loading - ENHANCED
**Problem**: Database was empty after initialization, making it hard to test features

**Solution**: Created automatic seed data system that loads on server startup

**What's included**:
- **8 Sample Users** (UPDATED - was 4):
  - Emma Chen (pink theme) - Food & movie lover
  - Marcus Johnson (blue theme) - Fitness & BBQ enthusiast  
  - Sofia Rodriguez (green theme) - Books & philosophy (follows everyone!)
  - Liam O'Brien (orange theme) - Classic movies & brunch
  - Aisha Patel (yellow theme) - Indian food & sci-fi books
  - James Kim (red theme) - Action movies & Korean BBQ
  - Isabella Santos (purple theme) - Poetry & Brazilian cuisine
  - Noah Taylor (blue theme) - Rock music & business books
  
- **37 Sample Posts** across all categories (UPDATED - was 15):
  - 8 Restaurants with actual locations across US cities
  - 8 Movies (action, classics, foreign films, comedy)
  - 8 Songs (workout, chill, jazz, indie, rock)
  - 7 Books (fiction, philosophy, poetry, sci-fi)
  - 6 Other items (yoga mats, headphones, coffee, etc.)
  - Dates range from today to 16 days ago (tests all date groupings!)
  
- **Follow Relationships**: Complex social graph with Sofia following everyone, others following 2-3 people each

**How it works**:
- Seed data only loads once (won't duplicate on restarts)
- Uses device IDs like `seed_user_1` so they won't conflict with real users
- Data spans different dates to test the date grouping feature

## üîß Technical Notes

**Database Seeding**:
- Located in `server/db/seedData.js`
- Runs automatically on server start
- Checks for existing seed data to avoid duplicates
- Creates users, posts, and follow relationships

**To reset database with fresh seed data**:
```bash
rm scrapbook.db
npm run server
```

**API Working**: All endpoints tested and functioning:
- `/api/users` - Returns all users including sample data
- `/api/posts` - Returns all 15 sample posts
- `/api/users/theme` - Theme switching works correctly

## ‚ú® Next Steps

You can now:
1. Test all features with realistic sample data
2. Create your own account alongside the sample users
3. See how the social features work with multiple users
4. Filter by categories to find specific types of recommendations
5. Try different color themes

The sample users will always be there when you restart, giving you a consistent baseline for testing!
